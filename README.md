🍅 Tomato Disease Detector – AI-Powered Desktop App
This project is a standalone Python GUI application that uses a deep learning model to detect tomato plant diseases from leaf images. It features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter and runs entirely offline — no internet or server needed.

🧠 Features
🔍 AI-based Prediction: Classifies tomato leaf images using a trained ResNet-18 model

🖼️ Image Upload GUI: Clean, simple interface to upload and analyze images

📦 Packaged as .exe / .msi: Installable on any Windows system

🧠 Works Offline: Model and logic are bundled inside the app — no external API calls

🚀 Tech Stack
Python 3.10+
